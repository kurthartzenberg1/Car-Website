Hyman Ltd. Classic Cars was created in 1989 as a result of Mark Hyman’s interest in antique, classic and special interest automobiles. <br>
Beginning in a small rented garage of approximately 4,000 sq ft., the business quickly grew and in 1992 was moved to a new 12000 sq ft.<br>
building in Ferguson, MO.<br>
In 2004, we moved to our current location — a beautiful 35,000 sq ft. facility located near the St. Louis International Airport.<br>
In 2014 we added an additional 32,000 sq ft. adjacent to our current location. Today, our state of the art 67,000 sq ft. facility houses our sales department, restoration, repair facilities as well as our showroom and administrative offices.<br>
At Hyman Ltd., we specialize in the acquisition and sale of prewar Classic automobiles and post war American collectible cars, as well as both pre and post war sports cars.<br>
We are well known for having some of the most unusual collector vehicles and we strive to find something that you have never heard of.<br>
We aggressively search throughout the country for cars that meet our standards of quality and desirability. <br>
We act as principals in the purchase of the cars, and while we do accept select consignments, the vast majority of the vehicles on hand are owned by Hyman Ltd. <br>
We cater to collectors and museums both in the United States and internationally.<br>
As a result, we are quite well versed in the intricate procedures sometimes associated with shipping vehicles to other parts of the world.<br></br>
